Jarvis : Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are pivotal aspects of modern technology. AI refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. On the other hand, machine learning is an essential subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves using algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make predictions or take actions based on that information.
